# MMIST-ccRcc
ccRCC is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for up to 80% of all renal cell carcinoma cases in adults. Estimating the prognosis is critical for patient management, but it is still a very challenging task. Ongoing research on this topic has led to the creation of two public studies: CPTAC-CCRCC and TCGA-KIRC, from which we curated MMIST-ccRCC.
